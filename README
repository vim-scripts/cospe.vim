cospe.vim is a vim plugin for pasting to http://cos.pe

This script is a copy of dpaste.vim but paste into cos.pe instead dpaste.com

Thanks to Alexandre Fiori for creating cos.pe and Bartek Ciszkowski Maintainer of dpaste.vim. 

Usage: 
- :Cospe  (create a paste from the current buffer or selection) 

You can also map paste to CTRL + P, just add this to your .vimrc: 
map ^P :Dpaste<CR> 
(where ^P is entered using CTRL + V, CTRL + P in Vim)
